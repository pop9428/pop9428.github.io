here are 8
.1 MESSAGE - Change your phone message on April Fools Day: record your voice saying in a creepy voice  "Hello. (pause) Hello? (another pause) Is anyone there?? After another pause, finish it up with "APRIL FOOL!

2. PALMS DOWN - Tell a friend that you know a great trick. Put your hand palm-down on the table and balance a full glass of water on the back of your hand. Bet your friend that they can’t balance a glass on both hands at once (help your friend to put them in place). As soon as you have the glasses balanced on the prospects hands, stand up and walk out. They will be trapped and will have to spill to escape.
3.BOILED - Take the eggs from someone’s or yours refrigerator and hard-boil them. Then put them back where you found them. Can work well when camping, only do a few if you want breakfast!

3.i see a snake - All you need is a rubber snake and some fishing line. Tie the fishing line around the snake and then attach the other end of the line to the inside of a cupboard or anything that opens and closes. Set it up so that when they open the door/cupboard the snake will jump out. Or simply set it up to drag across the lounge floor while everyone is watching TV!
SNAKE! - All you need is a rubber snake and some fishing line. Tie the fishing line around the snake and then attach the other end of the line to the inside of a cupboard or anything that opens and closes. Set it up so that when they open the door/cupboard the snake will jump out. Or simply set it up to drag across the lounge floor while everyone is watching TV!

4.size ISSUE - If you can get the exact same clothes as the target except get them a size smaller - Swop with the original! Another favorite is to cut the cotton of the back seam in someone's jeans a few times for split pants! Be prepared to replace or FIX though!
OH DEAR - Fold the flat sheet on the bed double and tuck in securely on the sides, when the person get into bed they can't go further than half way!
5.SPRAY - Stick some duck tape on the nozzle of a kitchen sink or bathroom tap - leave a little gap towards the front where someone will stand! Old but it works every time!
6.DUAL REMOTE - Spend the money to get a second matching or dual remote. Change channels while they are watching. The secret to this prank is to not overuse it. If you use it in small doses you can carry this one on for weeks not just on April Fools Day.
7.FAKE CAKE - Take a round car-washing sponge, or a piece of craft foam, and decorate it with cake frosting, sprinkles, etc. Then try not to laugh when the victim struggles to cut themselves some cake. This one gets 5 STARS for Good Pranks.
8.sick- when someones sick fron school. the next day with you and your friends act like one of your friends eg: one of my freinds is sporty and then one of my other friends is  more girly so im gonig  to name my sporty friend Sam and my other friend sally if sally act like sam
and sam acts like sally then i act like the girl who's sick then we treat the girl who was sick like me she will be so confused but every one  stays with there name.
